# Learning by Gradient Descent


## Abstract


## How to run the experiments
- Make sure you have Python 3.7.6 installed
- `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python Experiment*.py`


## Experiment Description
- **Experiment 1**: Observe Empirical error (E) with time, Observe Validation error (E_test) with time;	for one run of the training process

- **Experiment 2**: Compare E and E_test by taking the average over R runs

- **Experiment 4**: Return display the initial and final weights of the network

- **Experiment 5**: Compare Different values of P

- **Experiment 6**: Effects of different learning rates on empirical and validation error

- **Experiment 7**: Effects of using more hidden units (k>2) and adaptive hidden-to-output layer

- **Experiment 8**: Training on real-world dataset
